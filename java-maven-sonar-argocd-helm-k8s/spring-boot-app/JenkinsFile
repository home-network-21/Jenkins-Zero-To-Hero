It seems like your pipeline syntax is incomplete. The pipeline block needs to be closed properly, and there are some missing components like the agent directive. Here is a corrected version of your Jenkins pipeline:

groovy
Copy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'hello'
            }
        }
    }
}
